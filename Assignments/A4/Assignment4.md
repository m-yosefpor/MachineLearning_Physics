Make yourown code for NN including 
- Back-prop
- feedforward
- Mini-batch 
- Gradient Descent with Adaptive Learning Rate 
- Gradient Descent with RMSprop, Momentum and Adam optimization methods

Try different learning rate and different optimization techniques and see how affect the training.

Try different batch-size and see how that affect the training.
